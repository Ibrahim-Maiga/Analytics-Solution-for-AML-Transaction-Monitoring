This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable ETL pipeline for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) transaction monitoring. Leveraging AWS services, it extracts data from an Aurora MySQL database, processes it with AWS Glue, and stores it in S3 for analysis with Amazon Athena. Perfect for those interested in data engineering, finance, and compliance, this guide highlights practical decisions in cost control, security, and the principles of least privilege, creating a robust, hands-on project experience.
